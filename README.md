# Snekoban

Welcome to Snekoban, a puzzle game where the player controls a little python to push computers around a board surrounded by walls. The objective is to push each computer onto a target until every target is covered with a computer.

## Game Elements

There are four types of objects in Snekoban:

### Player
The player (the green python) controls that moves around the board using the arrow keys. The player attempts to move in the direction of the pressed arrow key and push objects according to the rules below.

### Walls
Walls are stationary objects that block movement. If the player or a computer tries to move into a wall, they remain in their original position.

### Computers
Computers can be pushed around the board by the player. If the player moves into a computer, the computer is pushed in the same direction, unless it would move into a wall or another computer, in which case nothing moves.

### Targets
Targets are the locations (marked by flags) where computers need to be pushed. They are stationary and can be occupied by the player or a computer.

## Objective
The goal of Snekoban is to push all computers onto targets. The game is won when every target is covered by a computer. Some puzzles may start with computers already on targets, but in some cases, the solution may involve moving computers away temporarily.

Enjoy the game!
